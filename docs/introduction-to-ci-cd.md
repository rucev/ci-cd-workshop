# Introduction to CI/CD 

Once upon a time, software development faced constant challenges such as manual code integration, inconsistent environments, and lengthy release cycles. This often led to delays, bugs slipping into production, and frustrated development teams.

Luckily for us, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) are here to save the day. CI/CD addresses many pain points head-on by promoting a culture of automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement. By breaking down the separation between development, testing, and operations, CI/CD enables teams to deliver software in smaller, more frequent releases, facilitating faster feedback loops and mitigating risks associated with large, infrequent updates.

Continuous Integration focuses on frequent code integration and automated testing to maintain a stable codebase, while Continuous Delivery extends this practice to automate the entire software release process, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software to customers rapidly and reliably. Let's focus a bit more on each one.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where team members integrate their code changes into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. The key idea is to ensure that the software remains in a working state at all times, even as new features are added or bugs are fixed.

> Knowing that software was successfully "built" with the latest changes is valuable, but knowing that software was built *correctly* is invaluable, as software defects will undoubtedly creep into a code base at some point. The reason you want to build *continuously* is to get rapid feedback so that you can find and fix problems throuhout the development lifecycle.  
[Continuous Integration *by Paul Duvall, Steve Matyas, and Andrew Glover*](https://martinfowler.com/books/duvall.html)

Imagine a team of developers working on an e-commerce platform. Each developer works on a specific feature (for example, "save to buy later" or "recommended based on your searches") and commits their changes to the central repository multiple times throughout the day. As soon as a developer pushes their changes, the CI server detects the new commit, pulls the latest code, and triggers a series of automated processes:

- **Build:** The CI server compiles the code to ensure that it can be successfully built without errors.
- **Automated Tests:** A suite of automated tests is executed to verify that the changes haven't introduced any errors to previously working features.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Additional checks for code style, test coverage, and other quality metrics may be performed to maintain code hygiene.

If any errors are detected during these automated processes, the CI server notifies the team immediately, allowing them to address the issues before they escalate. By integrating frequently and automating the validation process, the team can catch and fix issues early, ensuring a stable codebase and accelerating the development cycle.

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery (CD) builds on CI principles and goes a bit further by automating the entire software release process, from code integration to deployment in production-like environments. In a CD pipeline, every change that passes through the CI process is potentially shippable, meaning it could be deployed to production at any time with a single command. This approach minimizes manual interventions and reduces the time and risk associated with releasing software.

> Performing manual build, test and deployment processes is boring and repetitive- far from the best use of people. People are expensive and valuable, and they should be focused on producing software that delights its users.  
[Continuous Delivery *by Jez Humble and David Farley*](https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html)

Building on the previous example, let's say the e-commerce platform's development team has implemented CD. Once the code changes have passed all automated tests and quality checks in the CI pipeline, they are automatically deployed to a staging or pre-production environment that closely resembles the production environment. This allows the team to conduct further testing, such as user acceptance testing (UAT) or performance testing, in an environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.

Once the changes have been validated in the staging environment and approved for release, they can be easily deployed to production with minimal manual intervention. This could involve automated deployment scripts or integration with deployment tools like Kubernetes or AWS CodeDeploy. By automating the deployment process and ensuring that every change is deployable, CD enables teams to release new features and updates to customers quickly and with confidence.

## Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment (CD, again) takes the principles of Continuous Delivery one step further by automating the entire software release process, from code integration to deployment into production, without any manual intervention. With Continuous Deployment, every code change that passes the automated testing stages is automatically deployed to the live production environment, making it possible to deliver features, bug fixes, or enhancements to customers as soon as they are ready.

> Continuous deployment could be dismissed as a trivial subcategory within continuous  delivery, but this underestimates the radical simplicity of an automated pipeline that goes straight through from push to production.  
[Continuous Deployment *by Valentina Servile*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-deployment/9781098146719/)

Imagine the e-commerce platform implements a "Flash Sale" feature, allowing users to buy products at steep discounts for a limited time. The feature needs to be rolled out quickly due to changing market conditions. With Continuous Deployment, the developers can build the feature, commit the changes, and, after passing the automated checks, have it live in production within hours. No manual intervention is needed, and customers can start using the new feature almost instantly.


## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that code changes go through from development to deployment. It ensures that every change made to the codebase is automatically built, tested, and deployed in a consistent and reliable manner.

> At an abstract level, a deployment pipeline is an automated manifestation of your process for getting software from version control into the hands of your users.  
[Continuous Delivery *by Jez Humble and David Farley*](https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html)

Let's break down the key stages typically found in a CI/CD pipeline:

**1. Code Commit**

The pipeline starts when a developer commits code changes to the version control system. This triggers the CI/CD pipeline to initiate the automated process.

**2. Build**

In this stage, the code is pulled from the version control system and compiled into executable binaries.
Build tools like Maven, Gradle, or npm scripts are commonly used to automate this process. The goal is to ensure that the code can be successfully compiled and packaged.

**3. Automated Testing**

Once the code is built, it undergoes a series of automated tests to validate its functionality, performance, and security.

**4. Static Code Analysis**

This stage involves analyzing the code for potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and code style violations without executing the code.
Static code analysis tools like ESLint are used to identify issues and enforce coding standards.

**5. Artifact Generation**

After the code passes all tests and analysis, artifacts (executable files, libraries, documentation) are generated. These artifacts represent the deployable units that will be deployed to the target environment.

**6. Deployment**

The final stage of the pipeline involves deploying the artifacts to the target environment, such as staging or production servers. It can be automated using deployment tools like Docker or Kubernetes. The goal is to ensure that the application is deployed consistently and reliably across different environments.

## Key Components of CI/CD

### Version Control

Version control systems like Git are fundamental to CI/CD pipelines. They track changes to source code over time and facilitate collaboration among developers working on the same codebase.

Using version control systems ensures that all changes to the codebase are tracked, providing a history of modifications and enabling developers to revert to previous versions if needed. It also facilitates concurrent development by allowing multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously.

### Automated Builds

Automated build tools like Maven or Gradle automate the process of compiling source code into executable binaries or deployable artifacts. CI systems trigger these builds automatically whenever new code is pushed to the version control repository.

With these tools, we ensure the consistency and reliability of our app by removing the manual effort required to compile code. They detect compilation errors early in the development cycle, allowing developers to address issues quickly. Additionally, automated builds enable reproducible builds, ensuring that the same source code always produces the same result.

### Automated testing

An essential component of CI/CD pipelines is using unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (e2e) tests. CI systems automatically execute these tests as part of the pipeline to validate changes and ensure the integrity of the codebase.

By running tests automatically upon each code change, developers receive immediate feedback on the impact of their modifications. This leads to faster identification and resolution of issues, resulting in more stable and reliable software.

### Artifact Repository

Artifact repositories such as Docker Hub serve as centralized storage for build artifacts, dependencies, and other binary assets produced during the CI/CD process.

Artifact repositories facilitate the management and distribution of builds, providing an API to automatically deploy them to the environments in our pipeline. Additionally, artifact repositories optimize build performance by caching dependencies and promoting reuse of builds across development environments.


## Benefits of CI/CD

- **Faster Time to Market**: CI/CD automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, enabling rapid iteration and shorter release cycles.

- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested before deployment. Continuous delivery ensures that only code that passes all tests and meets quality standards is deployed, leading to higher-quality software.

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: CI/CD encourages collaboration between development, QA, and operations teams by providing a centralized platform for code integration, testing, and deployment.

- **Reduced Manual Errors**: Automation eliminates the need for manual intervention in repetitive tasks such as building and deploying code, reducing the risk of human error.

- **Increased Deployment Reliability**: CI/CD promotes consistency and repeatability in the deployment process, reducing the variability introduced by manual deployments.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: CI/CD pipelines can be easily scaled to accommodate growing development teams and increasingly complex software projects. With the ability to define custom pipelines and workflows, CI/CD systems offer flexibility to adapt to the specific needs and requirements of different projects and organizations.

- **Cost Savings**: By streamlining the development and deployment process, CI/CD helps organizations optimize resource utilization and reduce operational overhead.

- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: CI/CD builds around a culture of continuous improvement by providing feedback loops at every stage of the development lifecycle. Developers receive immediate feedback on their code changes through automated tests and metrics, enabling them to identify and address issues early in the development process.
