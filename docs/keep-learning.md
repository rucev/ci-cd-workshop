# Keep Learning

Now that you've built the core CI/CD pipeline and integrated Husky into your project, it's time to explore advanced strategies and customize your pipeline further. Below are some steps to guide your continued learning.

## Improve Your Husky Hooks
- **More Commit Control:** Use tools like [commitlint or prettier](https://theodorusclarence.com/shorts/husky-commitlint-prettier) to enforce coding standards and control commit message formatting. This will help maintain a clean and consistent codebase.
- **Pre-Push Hooks:** Beyond pre-commit hooks, you can introduce pre-push hooks that prevent problematic code from being pushed to critical branches (like `main` or `production`). For instance, pre-push hooks can run integration tests, check code coverage, or validate environment settings before pushing.
- **Custom Hooks:** Explore Husky's full potential by adding hooks like post-merge or `post-rebase` to automate `post-merge` tasks. This could include actions like installing new dependencies or running migrations to keep your development environment up to date..


## Learn About CI/CD Strategies
- **Rollback Mechanisms:** Implement automatic rollback strategies in your CI/CD pipeline to restore the previous stable version of your app if a deployment fails. This ensures minimal downtime and greater reliability in production environments.
- **Canary Releases & Blue-Green Deployments:** Experiment with canary releases to deploy updates to a small subset of users before rolling out to everyone. Similarly, learn about blue-green deployments, which allow seamless switching between two identical environments, ensuring zero downtime.

## Improve and Personalize Your Pipeline
- **Custom Pipelines:** Every project has unique needs. Extend your CI/CD pipeline by adding steps for linting, security scanning, or static code analysis. You can also add more detailed build steps, like generating documentation or running performance tests.
- **Service Providers:** While you may be familiar with services like Netlify or Render, try experimenting with other platforms such as Vercel or Surge to diversify your deployment experience. Different platforms may offer optimizations or features better suited to your specific project needs.
- **Environment-Specific Pipelines:** Create pipelines tailored to different environments, such as development, staging, and production. This enables you to have more granular control over which branches trigger deployments, and ensures that test branches are deployed to staging environments, while only stable branches are pushed to production.
- **Learn More aAbout GitHub Actions:** Explore advanced features of GitHub Actions, such as reusable workflows, caching strategies, and using third-party action packages to automate various tasks in your development lifecycle.

## Advance to Higher Levels of Automation

### 1. Containerization with Docker
Start learning how to containerize your applications with Docker. Containers allow your app and its dependencies to run in isolated environments, ensuring consistency between development, staging, and production. Create Docker images for your frontend, backend, and database services.

Consider using Docker Compose to link multiple containers, enabling you to spin up your entire stack (e.g., backend, frontend, and database) with a single command.

### 2. Orchestration with Kubernetes
Once you master Docker, move to Kubernetes to manage and scale your containerized applications. Kubernetes provides tools for automating deployments, scaling workloads, and managing the health of your services in a clustered environment.

Key concepts to learn include Pods, Deployments, Services, and Ingress Controllers, which will help you scale and manage distributed applications efficiently.

### 3. Cloud Deployment
Once you have your application containerized and orchestrated, deploying to the cloud becomes the next logical step. Services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure provide a range of managed infrastructure services, including Kubernetes clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS) and automated scaling tools.

Learn how to deploy your Docker containers or Kubernetes clusters to the cloud, manage resources effectively, and monitor your production environment with built-in cloud tools.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
To manage cloud resources efficiently, adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. Tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation allow you to define, automate, and version-control your cloud infrastructure setup. With IaC, you can replicate environments with ease, ensure consistency, and automate resource management.

Start by creating infrastructure modules with Terraform to provision cloud resources such as servers, databases, and networks on AWS, GCP, or Azure.
